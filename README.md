# tomlfmt

A very naive toml formatter that is not very likely to work everywhere.  I am
using this until I find a better one, if that doesn't happen maybe I will make
this one better.

## Installation.

``` bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/waylonwalker/tomlfmt
tomlfmt -i pyproject.toml
```
